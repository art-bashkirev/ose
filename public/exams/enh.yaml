              History’s account of musical brilliance is often filled with paradox, none more so than the fates that befell some of Europe’s most illustrious composers.
              Their deaths, colored by violence, neglect, or ambiguous legacy, challenge the romantic notion that genius earns reward or peace.
              Instead, the closing chapters of their lives can read more like tragic comedy than serenely concluded prose.

              Consider Jean-Marie Leclair, whose works radiate ease and are often considered “sugary music”.
              In 1764, Leclair was found stabbed to death in his Paris home, a case so entangled with family suspicion that it remains unsolved.
              The strongest suspicion lies on his family members. However, the motives behind others could not be considered pertinent at the time.

              A more sardonic end awaited Jean-Baptiste Lully, the founding father of French Opera.
              Lully’s career thrived at the glittering court of Louis XIV, yet he met his undoing with the very instrument of his vocation.
              Striking his own foot with a conducting staff mid-performance, he developed gangrene but refused amputation, resulting in his untimely death.
              The circumstance brimmed with the twisted humor of fate: a master of musical control felled by an accidental lapse.

              Rameau’s passing in 1764, by contrast, attracted less drama but not less complexity.
              Renowned for his theoretical innovations, the pioneering Baroque composer interrupted a priest's hymn with his renowned rebuke “What the devil do you mean to sing to me, priest? You are out of tune.”
              Yet conflicting reports about his state of mind linger, although all highlight the composer's unyielding ear.

              Not all tragedy is loud.
              Antonio Vivaldi, whose concertos overflow with exuberance, died in Vienna far from the acclaim that had once surrounded him.
              Aimless patronage and shifting tastes condemned him to poverty in his final years; he was buried in a pauper’s grave, less a celebrated icon than a cautionary tale.
              Decades of neglect muted his voice until a twentieth-century revival rekindled interest in the “Red Priest”.

              Then there is Alessandro Stradella, whose career oscillated between genius and scandal.
              Infamous for brazen affairs and debts, Stradella’s murder in Genoa was as sensational as his life.
              The circumstances - revenge, jealousy, financial disputes—are inseparable from the music, fueling speculation and affording his works a certain illicit allure.

              Some musical legacies are haunted not by violence but by ambiguity.
              Josquin des Prez, celebrated in his time, became a figure of almost mythic inscrutability.
              Attribution of his works spiraled into confusion as later composers and copyists freely borrowed his name, muddying the historical record.
              His true voice now emerges only with persistent scholarship that sifts legend from fact.

              The annals of music abound in other troubled tales - Carlo Gesualdo’s tormented psyche, which shaped both his madrigals and infamous crimes, and the quiet pathos of Antonio Salieri, caricatured for centuries in connection to Mozart’s demise.
              Or Heinrich Schütz, succumbed not to drama but to complete eclipse - his burial site was lost to history when Frauenkirche was torn down to be completely rebuilt.
              In the sweep of history, reputations have risen, fallen, and been reborn. a reminder that the end of life is rarely the end of a story.

          ## A Voyage to Lübeck

          In late 1705, Johann Sebastian Bach, still not long out of his teens, set out for Lübeck – a journey that would stretch far beyond its expected course. He had only asked for a short leave from Arnstadt, his employers presumably trusting he’d be back on schedule. **A** ______ Yet by the time Bach finally returned, winter was beginning to wane, and questions about his extended absence were circulating with increasing impatience.

          Bach’s motivation for the trip was, in some ways, no secret. With Dieterich Buxtehude’s music filling Lutheran churches across the region, Lübeck had become something of a magnet for young musicians. **B** ______ When Bach reached the city, Buxtehude’s celebrated evening concerts were in full swing, offering a rare chance to hear the organist whose reputation loomed large over German music.

          What occupied Bach during his months away remains a topic of speculation rather than record. **C** ______ Some point to the lure of Buxtehude’s compositions, but others suspect there was more than admiration behind his prolonged stay.

          What Bach certainly discovered was that Buxtehude, after decades at the organ, was preparing to hand over his post – on one unmistakable condition. **D** ______ It was common knowledge among aspiring successors that anyone wanting the position would also be expected to marry Buxtehude’s daughter.

          Several well-known musicians besides Bach found themselves weighing the offer during these years. **E** ______ Whether Bach actually considered the proposal or simply took the opportunity to learn remains unclear, but what he gained in Lübeck would echo in his later music.

          To this day, how those months truly passed – intense study, awkward conversation, or both – is still mostly left to the imagination. **F** ______ The details, like Bach’s reasons, have faded, leaving only the music and the questions behind.
        options:
          - The offer was tempting, though the link between the position and marriage was far from unusual in those circles.
          - With so much uncertainty, it’s easy to see why later writers have filled the gaps with their own stories.
          - The chance to hear Buxtehude play was enough to pull musicians hundreds of miles from home.
          - Back then, a few weeks away might raise an eyebrow, but few expected a single trip to last nearly half a year.
          - Few reports mention Bach attending a few concerts but give little evidence that he formally sought any church position during his stay.
          - The arrangement left some eager, while others left the city once the catch became known.
          - It was well known that Bach had gone for musical ambitions. The question was what else he hoped to gain.
          - Soon enough, word spread that the job came with a commitment well beyond music.
          - It’s not hard to imagine that Lübeck’s musical life was at the heart of his journey, though practical matters may have played a part.
          - Whatever his intentions, the city’s impact on Bach is difficult to miss in his work after his return.

          ## The North German Organ School

          The North German Organ School, which peaked primarily in the 17th and early 18th centuries, is one of the most significant movements in Western music history.
          This musical tradition originated in the prosperous Hanseatic cities of northern Germany, where exceptional organ craftsmanship and Lutheran worship practices fostered an ideal atmosphere for musical innovation.
          The unique characteristics of the movement, such as virtuosic improvisation, complex contrapuntal techniques, and specific stylistic contrasts, had a significant impact on keyboard composition in Europe.

          Lutheran liturgical practices in northern Germany after the Reformation gave organists a level of creative freedom never before possible.
          Lutheran organists created preludes based on hymn melodies and musical interludes between verses, in contrast to their Catholic counterparts who were mainly limited to providing accompaniment for pre-existing choral works.
          This practice led to the development of the chorale prelude, a renowned Lutheran musical form that would become prominent in the North German tradition.

          The foundational figure of the North German Organ School was Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck (1562-1621), often called the "Orpheus of Amsterdam."
          Though Dutch rather than German, Sweelinck taught many northern German organists in Amsterdam, earning the nickname "the maker of German organists."
          His synthesis of English, Italian, and Franco-Flemish styles created a distinctive approach to keyboard writing that his German students would further develop. 
          Sweelinck's variations on sacred and secular melodies established methods of ornamentation and subject development that would stretch through centuries.
          Sweelinck's approach to chorale settings - clear presentation of the subject with increasingly elaborate variations established a model that would be expand upon in most compositions of this style.

          Among Sweelinck's most influential pupils was Samuel Scheidt (1587-1654), who served as court organist in Halle.
          His publication Tabulatura Nova (1624) was one of the first German keyboard works printed in standard notation rather than tablature—established important precedents for organ composition in northern Germany.
          The collection includes 58 compositions demonstrating Scheidt's approach to chorale variations and his integration of multinational influences.
          Particularly noteworthy are his sets of variations on chorale melodies which employ different contrapuntal devices in each variation.
          His innovations in chorale treatment included the cantus firmus chorale, in which the melody appears in long notes in one voice against counterpoint in the others, and the chorale motet, which treats each phrase of the chorale melody as a subject for imitative development.

          Although best known for his vocal compositions, Heinrich Schütz (1585–1672) was instrumental in the formation of the North German style.
          The concertato style was incorporated into German music by Schütz after he studied with Giovanni Gabrieli in Venice.
          The Italian innovations, such as expressive text declamation or virtuosic vocal writing, were adapted to German Protestant contexts in his Symphoniae Sacrae and Kleine geistliche Konzerte.
          Declamatory passages in many North German organ works were influenced by his refined approach to text setting.
          He also established antiphonal exchange and spatial arrangement practices that would influence instrumental compositions by introducing German music to the polychoral techniques of the Venetian school through the publication of the Psalmen Davids in 1619.

          Johann Adam Reincken (1643-1722), another pivotal figure in this tradition, studied with Sweelinck's pupil Heinrich Scheidemann before becoming organist at Hamburg's Katharinenkirche, then holding it for an incredible 54 years.
          One of the heights of his implementation of the North German form is his chorale fantasia "An Wasserflüssen Babylon," which is performed for almost 20 minutes.
          The work begins with a common presentation of the chorale melody, followed by already established style - progressively complex variations, with each section exhibiting different figurative patterns - running sixteenth notes, triplet figures, and brilliant toccata-like passages, while maintaining the structural framework of the chorale.
          In addition, Reincken's "Hortus Musicus," a collection of chamber sonatas, demonstrates his familiarity with Italian styles, in particular sonata da chiesa and sonata da camera.

          The North German organ style is characterized by several features that set it apart from other keyboard traditions.
          The “stylus phantasticus”, a term coined by theorist Athanasius Kircher, describes the improvisatory quality that pervades much of this repertoire.
          Works of this school typically use contrasting sections of free passages with strictly contrapuntal writing.
          The final evolvement of the tradition is the multi-sectional praeludia (preludes) that incorporates distinct stylistic elements within a single composition.
          A typical praeludium begins with an improvisatory toccata featuring dramatic scalar passages and arpeggiated figurations, followed by a strict fugal section, before concluding with another free section.

          After J.S. Bach's passing, the North German tradition faded as musical tastes shifted towards homophonic textures and Classical clarity.
          However this musical tradition's unique qualities had already secured its place as one of the most important advancements in Baroque keyboard music.

          ## Querelle des Bouffons

          In 1752, Parisian audiences were [30] when Giovanni Battista Pergolesi’s intermezzo *La serva padrona* was [31] at the Académie royale de musique.
          What at first seemed a lighthearted diversion soon [32] a ferocious debate between adherents of venerable French *tragédie lyrique* and champions of the new Italian *opera buffa*.
          Proponents of the French tradition [33] against the Italian intermezzo, accusing it of having [34] centuries of refined musical decorum in favour of frivolous antics.
          At the same time, critics like Rousseau and Grimm [35] to underline the merits of operatic simplicity and natural sentiment, insisting that French style [36] genuine warmth and spontaneity.
