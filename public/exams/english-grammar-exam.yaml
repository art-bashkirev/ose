          ## Going on a hike

          Simon and I were in a school football team. Occasionally, the team took field trips to places outside of our neighborhood on the weekends. Last week, our coach Mr. Brown [30] _______ we were going on a hike through a forest in a state park.

          Simon is my best friend, and the two of us had both liked the trips to the museums, plays, and basketball games. We weren't all that [31] _______ in the outdoors. Mr. Brown claimed that we'd really enjoy discovering how amazing nature can be – especially for the big city kids. Simon and I were sure we'd rather be back home playing video games.

          Now we were in a state park, marching through woods as [32] _______ as a grizzly bear's fur. Our group of 12 kids had been hiking for a good 30 minutes when Simon and I grew bored and stepped away from the group to take some pictures.

          I looked around, shouting, "Check out that tree – it's kinda cool. Doesn't its shape [33] _______ you of an elephant?"

          "That it does," Simon replied. "And look at how those rocks are formed over there. You don't see stuff like that in the city, now do you?"

          For the next few minutes, we got caught up in [34] _______ flowers, leaves, animals, and little caves we hadn't seen before. The deeper we went into the forest, the more it opened up to us. We were beginning to see the amazing things around us.

          Out here, away from the city, I was starting to get what Mr. Brown had [35] _______ about how wonderful nature could be.

            text: "The first decision when visiting England is whether to travel by private car or use the extensive public transport system. Having your own car means you can make the best use of time and reach remote places, but rental and fuel costs can be expensive and finding parking is difficult. London has an excellent public transport network, which includes a reliable system of trains and coaches (buses), is often the better choice for getting around in the United Kingdom. Aside from London, England's city centres with multiple pedestrian streets are very walkable."
          - letter: B
            text: "For long-distance travel around England, trains are generally faster and more comfortable than buses but are usually much more expensive. The English like to moan about their trains, but around 85% run on time, and major stations are well-equipped – with super helpful staff and a range of food outlets. If you have a flexible schedule, train tickets can be much cheaper if booked exceptionally early, so it is always worth booking as far in advance as you can. Sometimes buying two single tickets works out cheaper than buying a return."
          - letter: C
            text: "Long-distance buses are known as coaches in the UK, and services run between all major towns and cities. If you're on a tight budget, coaches are nearly always the cheapest way to get around England, although they are also the slowest and sometimes less comfortable. If you book early or travel at off-peak periods, coach tickets can be very cheap. If you are under the age of 26, there is also a RailCard, and it's very cheap. If you are with a small group of friends and you make it in time for your flight. The two major coach companies are National Express and Megabus."
          - letter: D
            text: "Travelling by car or motorcycle around England means you have more flexibility and mobility, and you can reach more remote parts of the country. Downsides for drivers include regular traffic jams, the high price of fuel, the cost of car insurance, and parking fees in cities and tourist towns. Compared with many other countries, England is a small place. If you have time, by using a mix of train, bus, taxi, walking and occasionally hiring a car, you can get almost anywhere in England without having to drive."
