          Going on a hike

          Simon and I were in a school football team. Occasionally, the team took field trips to places outside of our neighborhood on the weekends. Last week, our coach Mr. Brown [30] _______ we were going on a hike through a forest in a state park.

          Simon is my best friend, and the two of us had both liked the trips to the museums, plays, and basketball games. We weren't all that [31] _______ in the outdoors. Mr. Brown claimed that we'd really enjoy discovering how amazing nature can be – especially for the big city kids. Simon and I were sure we'd rather be back home playing video games.

          Now we were in a state park, marching through woods as [32] _______ as a grizzly bear's fur. Our group of 12 kids had been hiking for a good 30 minutes when Simon and I grew bored and stepped away from the group to take some pictures.

          I looked around, shouting, "Check out that tree – it's kinda cool. Doesn't its shape [33] _______ you of an elephant?"

          "That it does," Simon replied. "And look at how those rocks are formed over there. You don't see stuff like that in the city, now do you?"

          For the next few minutes, we got caught up in [35] _______ flowers, leaves, animals, and little caves we hadn't seen before. The deeper we went into the forest, the more it opened up to us. We were beginning to see the amazing things around us.

          Out here, away from the city, I was starting to get what Mr. Brown had [36] _______ about how nature could be.
